# K-MeansClustering
K means clustering is a unsupervised learning problem. We were given a set of data points. We randomly chose two
points and took them as initial centroid. Then for every data
point we were given, I measured their Euclidian distance from
the two centroids, assigned the data to cluster according to their
lowest distance from any centroid. Then took the mean of each
cluster and calculated the distance from each given data point to
the mean. This was done until all assigned categories donâ€™t change
any more.
